**?criteria to identify an outlier?**
1.Data point that falls outside of 1.5 times of an interquartile range above the 3rd quartile and below the 1st quartile

2.Data point that falls outside of 3 standard deviations. we can use a z score and if the z score falls outside of 2 standard deviation

**What is the reason for an outlier to exists in a dataset?**
1)Variability in the data

2)An experimental measurement error

**What are the impacts of having outliers in a dataset?**
1)It causes various problems during our statistical analysis

2)It may cause a significant impact on the mean and the standard deviation

3)It will impact the model accuracy when we are using liner regression or logistic regression etc

4)outliers will missleads the results

**Various ways of finding the outlier**
1.Using scatter plots

2.Box plot

3.using z score

4.using the IQR interquantile range
